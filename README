	This project contains the code for performing Huffman enoding-decoding (or compression-decompression) for
	different files. The encoding and decoding procedures can be perfomed separately as we store the encoded
	output and the frequency files during the encoding phase.
	
	Running the code is fairly straightforward. This submission contains only two files: README and
	HuffmanSubmit.java. It depends on the files BinaryIn.java, BinaryOut.java and Huffman.java. Once all the
	files are in the same directory, the code can be compiled as follows:

	$ javac BinaryIn.java BinaryOut.java Huffman.java HuffmanSubmit.java

	Running the file HuffmanSubmit.java will take the input files ur.jpg as well as alice30.txt and apply the
	encoding and decoding procedure on both. This behavior can be changed through the main() function in the
	file HuffmanSubmit.java. In order to run the code (on command line):

	$ java HuffmanSubmit

	Using an IDE, none of the commands need to be run and it's fairly straightforward. The commands above are
	mentioned in case somebody needs to run this on command line.
