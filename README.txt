==================================================

The file containing the main function is PaintCanvasObjects.java.
It creates six JFrames and then renders the Graphics for each of the six questions in the Homework.
Each window contains the name of the Question it is an answer to on the top.

To run my submission, do the following:
--------------------------------------------------
Compilation:
javac PaintCanvasObjects.java
--------------------------------------------------
Execution:
java PaintCanvasObjects
--------------------------------------------------

This will open six windows, each with the Graphics rendering for one of the six questions.

-> Question-1: Simple drawLines with different colors and proper coordinates.

-> Question-2: A step function needed to increment / decrement the X and Y coordinates for the
               line ends.

-> Question-3: Simply repreat the way of increment / decrement for opposite corner Fans. Only the
               starting point for them changes.

-> Question-4: Draw lines such that they fill the area under a 90 degree arc of an ellipse curve.
               Used equation of ellipse (x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 = 1), for finding out proper start and
               endpoints for each line drawn. The code with provide a better understanding.

-> Question-5: Again, use symmetry for opposite corner arcs and draw them. Once 4 was done, this was
               simple enough.

-> Question-6: Draw concentric circles, each having a constant increment in their Radius. The colors should
               be different, alternate or looping. I did the looping part.
